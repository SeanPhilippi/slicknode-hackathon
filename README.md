## Objective

The purpose of this hackathon was to learn how to use a new and emerging tool called
[Slicknode](https://www.slicknode.com)

**Slicknode**  
This tool allows a user to rapidly deploy modular GraphQL backends based off a schema file
or each module, as well as module permissions

**Hackathon Process**  
We had 10 hours to develop a full stack application with GraphQL as the backend
(built & deployed using Slicknode), with a NodeJS + React frontend

## What we Built

Our team decided to build an app that acts as a video game collection index. There is a list
of available PlayStation 3 games, and the user can add a game to their personal collection if
they have it in real life

The idea was inspired by the over-abundance of PlayStation 3 games. This caused confusion
for serious game collectors due to the fact that they would occassionally buy a game they already
owned (unintentionally)

So our video game index app featuring user collections aimed to solve this issue

### Can I see it?

Unfortunately, at the moment, due to restrictions from Slicknode being in beta testing, we
cannot keep out GraphQL backend online after 1hr of inactivity

We are currently looking for a solution around this, so that we can host it for everyone to see!

## Technologies Used

- NodeJS
- React
- GraphQL
- Apollo React (GraphQL client)
- Reactstrap (Bootstrap 4)
